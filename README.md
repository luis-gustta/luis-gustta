# 👋 Hey there! I'm @luis-gustta

🚀 **Playing with fluids, cells & a bit of chaos**  
🔬 **Making sense of randomness with Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics**  
🤖 **Tinkering with simulations, optimization & machine learning**

## 🛠️ Tech I Mess Around With

### 💻 **Code & Tools**
- 🐍 Python for hacking physics & making cool plots
- 💾 RaspberryPi + Micropython for when I feel like an engineer
- ⚡ C/C++ when Python feels too slow
- 📜 LaTeX for pretending my notes are research papers
- 🏗️ Bash & Linux because GUIs are overrated

### 🌌 **Physics & Math That Keep Me Up at Night**
- 🎲 Statistical Mechanics & Thermodynamics
- 🧿 Quantum Mechanics
- 🌊 Fluid Dynamics
- 🔄 Chaos & Dynamical Systems
- 🧑‍🔬 Particle Physics (especially with those barely existing, incredibly shy neutrinos)
- 📐 Differential Geometry
- 🧩 Numerical Methods

### 🔧 **Other Random Skills**
- 🛠️ Electronics & tinkering with hardware
- 🖧 Setting up servers & networks like a pro
- 🧪 Playing with chemicals (_safely_, I promise)

### 🌎 **Languages**
- 🇧🇷 Portuguese (native)
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇪🇸 Spanish
- 🇮🇹 Italian

## 🌱 What I'm Up To
- **Building simulations & solving physics puzzles**
- **Looking for cool projects to collaborate on**
- **Trying to get my code to run faster (without rewriting it in C)**
